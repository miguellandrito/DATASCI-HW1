Sharing passwords is as endemic to the Netflix experience as having your favorite show canceled two seasons in. So when the streaming service starts testing ways to curtail that practice, it understandably riles up the many, many people who have come to expect communal accounts as a matter of course. And yes, it is always annoying when a gravy train goes off the rails. But even if it\u2019s not Netflix\u2019s top priority here, you\u2019re much better off keeping your password to yourself.The limited test that Netflix introduced this week is basically a form of two-factor authentication, the kind you hopefully already have on most of your online accounts. Some users have begun to see the following prompt when settling in for a binge: \u201cIf you don\u2019t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.\u201d Below that, there\u2019s an option to get a code emailed or texted to the account owner, which you can enter to continue watching.\u00a0A source familiar with Netflix's trial says that the company is still in the very early stages, and sees the effort as a way both to verify who's using what accounts and to minimize the security issues inherent in unauthorized sharing.\u00a0Yes, security issues. And while Netflix\u2019s flirtation with a password-sharing crackdown is by no means altruistic\u2014not that anyone has read the terms of service, but it does specify that your account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals beyond your household\u201d\u2014it\u2019s also true that sharing user names and passwords with even your closest relations can have woesome consequences.\u201cThere seems to be a misunderstanding that sharing passwords with known individuals is not dangerous,\u201d says Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at security firm ESET. \u201cThe truth is that we shouldn\u2019t be sharing passwords, and adding multi-factor authentication will help this process remain better protected.\u201dOK, but why? What\u2019s the actual harm if I pass along my password to a cousin or not-so-casual acquaintance? It can come in a few forms. The most basic is also the most innocuous: While you might share your log-in with just one friend, you can\u2019t control how many people they then share it with, and how many people those people share it with, and on and on, like an old Faberge commercial. When WIRED senior writer Lily Hay Newman audited the Hulu account she herself was mooching off of a few years ago, she found more than 90 authorized devices.\u00a0Admittedly, freeloaders primarily threaten the cohesiveness of your recommendations lists. It\u2019s not the end of the world. They could also, though, steal whatever personal data your profile holds.The much bigger issue is that the wider the password circle gets, the more risk you personally take on that your password will become compromised. And given how often people reuse passwords across multiple sites and services, that means your exposure could extend far beyond Netflix.\u00a0\u201cBecause I shared my password with you, and you got hacked, that criminal now has my password,\u201d says Steve Ragan, a researcher at internet infrastructure company Akamai. \u201cAnd if I\u2019ve used that password anywhere else on the internet, the criminal\u2019s going to find it, and they\u2019re going to have access to that, too. It spreads. It\u2019s a compounding issue.\u201dThe practice of throwing a bunch of purloined user names and passwords at various services to see what sticks is known as credential stuffing, and it\u2019s hit the media industry particularly hard in recent years. Between January 2018 and December 2019, credential stuffing attacks targeting video services doubled, according to Akamai research. The media industry as a whole saw 18 billion attempts over that same stretch. When Disney+ launched, thousands of accounts immediately popped up on dark web markets as hackers sniffed out the password-reusers. \u201cShort term, what this is going to stop is the bulk sale of credentials of this type,\u201d says Ragan.\u00a0", "author": "Brian Barrett"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T19:14:48Z", "title": "The Pandemic Turns One, Vaccine Trials Adapt, and More News", "full_article": "The pandemic has raged for a year, vaccine trials contend with approved shots, and Biden signs a $1.9 trillion relief bill. Here\u2019s what you should know: Want to receive this weekly roundup and other coronavirus news? Sign up here!HeadlinesThe Covid-19 pandemic turns one year oldThis week marked one year since the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic and the seriousness of the situation seemed to crystallize in the national consciousness. In a televised anniversary address on Thursday night, President Biden offered heartening news: His administration is on track to distribute 100 million vaccine shots in his first 60 days, and expects to give out 2 million a day going forward. What\u2019s more, he said he will direct states to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.All of this means that if we\u2019re diligent about abiding by public health guidelines like mask-wearing and social distancing even after we\u2019ve been vaccinated, the end of this pandemic, at least as we know it, may be imminent. But what exactly does it mean to return to \u201cnormal\u201d? Psychologically, experts say recovering from the trauma and uncertainty of the past year won\u2019t happen overnight. As we emerge from survival mode, we\u2019ll have to renegotiate how and whom we live with and love. Relationships with friends and family may have been tested during this time, and many of us have lost loved ones.Ongoing vaccine trials must adapt to contend with approved shotsAs the vaccine rollout accelerates, drugmakers are facing a new dilemma: getting people to sign up for trials for new shots, where they might get a placebo instead of the real thing. In response, some are investigating new ways to run trials, like comparing their vaccine against one that\u2019s already been authorized. Nevertheless, new shots are getting closer to being approved. Novavax, for one, released encouraging efficacy data from its UK trial on Thursday, and it expects initial results from a 30,000-person trial in the US and Mexico in early April.The EU\u2019s vaccine rollout made progress this week, even as it also faced setbacks. On Thursday, Johnson and Johnson\u2019s shot became the region\u2019s fourth approved option. But a number of countries have paused their use of AstraZeneca\u2019s shot over concerns that it could cause blood clots. Nonetheless, Europe\u2019s drug regulator urged countries to press ahead, saying there\u2019s no evidence yet that the AstraZeneca vaccine is to blame and that the benefits of the shot still outweigh the risks.\u00a0Biden signs $1.9 trillion relief bill as the US prepares to rebuildOn Thursday, President Biden signed the US\u2019 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill into law. The aid package will allocate more than $6 billion to food-security programs, extend already expanded unemployment assistance, and send $1,400 checks to many Americans as soon as this weekend. Democrats and progressive policy advocates are heralding it as a much-needed, permanent expansion of the social safety net, while Republicans questioned the need for the bill when many states seem to be moving toward reopening on their own.This bill is just one of the many ways that this pandemic, and our post-pandemic recovery, have the potential to fundamentally reshape society. Covid-19 has pushed many American cities to rethink how they use space, reducing the area set aside for parking to make way for bikers and pedestrians. And many parents are coming away from a challenging year of largely remote learning with a keen sense of the structural changes our education system needs.\u00a0Daily DistractionYoung climate change activists are taking to TikTok to raise awareness about the planet.

But if you use the internet at all, you need one. Here are our favorites.One QuestionWhy do we need Covid-19 data that accounts for sexual orientation and gender identity?Many officials are hesitant to collect medical data that asks people for information about their sexual orientation and gender identity. But according to a new study from the CDC, sexual minority Americans have significantly higher rates of a number of chronic medical conditions that often correlate with more severe cases of Covid-19. Having more information about this would make it easier to gauge the toll of this pandemic on LGBTQ+ communities and tailor public health responses accordingly. Even including an option field on intake forms, surveys, and more could help us better understand the specific risks and needs of a vulnerable community.More From WIRED on Covid-19\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Premature babies and the lonely terror of a pandemic NICUHow to remember a disaster without being shattered by itThe raging evolutionary war between humans and Covid-19The secret behind North Dakota\u2019s speedy vaccine rolloutWe still don\u2019t know how well vaccines stop transmissionRead all of our coronavirus coverage here", "author": "Eve Sneider"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T18:48:16Z", "title": "A Bird-Feed Seller Beat a Chess Master. Then It Got Ugly", "full_article": "On March 2, Levy Rozman, in a pink sweater and round glasses, was streaming his Chess.com matches to 12,000 viewers over Twitch. \u201cAll right, this looks like a cheater,\u201d he said without pause, as he clicked on the pigeon icon of his opponent, Dewa_Kipas. Rozman, an international chess master, scrolled through the profile, disbelieving. His opponent had climbed nearly a thousand points in the span of a month, ranking 2,300 to Rozman\u2019s 2,431. And his profile didn\u2019t include the sort of title\u2014\u201cFIDE master,\u201d \u201cnational master\u201d\u2014that the ranking implied. In fact, Rozman would later discover, Dewa_Kipas, or \u201cfan god,\u201d was a bird-feed seller in Indonesia. Chat echoed back: \u201cLMAOOOO,\u201d \u201cCHEATER.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get some content here,\u201d said Rozman.Rozman has been playing in chess tournaments since he was seven. In 2011, he attained National Master status, and in 2018, International Master. Now 25, he\u2019s known not only on the chess circuit; like other top players, he has developed a large following on Twitch, on YouTube, and on Twitter. High-level chess has experienced an unprecedented online boom due to the pandemic. An average of 895 people watched chess streamers on Twitch on March 1, 2020; a year later that cumulative audience expanded to 21,491.In this majority-digital world for the 1,500-year-old game, it\u2019s tempting to trust that every truly high-level player would by now be a known quantity\u2014whether through International Chess Federation ratings or social media. Nobody could just come out of nowhere and dethrone a chess king, right?Rozman knew that if his opponent was cheating it would be a strange game; algorithms often make choices that most humans simply wouldn\u2019t. Still, small things baffled him. At Rozman\u2019s level, obvious moves typically play out in a couple of seconds. Dewa_Kipas regularly took between seven and 10 seconds to make any move against the chess master, even when he had just one or two options. Highlighting Dewa_Kipas\u2019s knight on his stream, Rozman said he was worried that his opponent might move it to A5. \u201cI would expect this, although it is a computer, so I also kind of expect some weird pawn play,\u201d he said. The knight moved to A5.\u201cIt\u2019s an insane situation.\u201dLevy Rozman, Chess International MasterIn their attempts to climb the competitive ladder, cheaters refer to AI-powered chess engines to inform their moves. And as chess has moved more and more online, cheating allegations have skyrocketed, according to top online chess site Chess.com. Rozman has himself turned cheat-hunting into a bit. On YouTube, where his thumbnails are full of silly faces and chess boards, Rozman ran a \u201ccatching cheaters\u201d series, which he spun into a similarly themed Discord channel. It\u2019s an entertaining break from the big-brain chess plays and long, thinky matches\u2014lighthearted morsels in the rapidly ballooning content economy of online chess.Twelve thousand viewers cheered Rozman on as he played against Dewa_Kipas. About 10 minutes in, his opponent\u2019s rook had blocked in Rozman\u2019s king. Black won. \u201cREPORT HIM!\u201d \u201cPOLICE!\u201d yelled chat.Rozman again perused his opponent\u2019s stats. Dewa_Kipas\u2019 accuracy, or similarity to how a chess engine would play, during the match was 94 percent; Rozman\u2019s was 76. Over its last 10 games, the account\u2019s accuracy never dipped below 80. It hit over 99 percent in two of those. Rozman reported him that day. Hours later, Chess.com banned the account.That night hateful messages, many written in Indonesian, began to fill Rozman\u2019s social feeds. Threats, even. His girlfriend received the same: \u201chey bitch, we will kill u soon haha, from indonesia :).\u201d Rozman was getting tagged on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, with accusations that he had leveraged his notoriety to ban a legitimate player. What sparked the onslaught, he would learn, was a post on an anime superfan\u2019s Facebook page.

Anniversaries, birthdays, freshman year, senior year, New Year\u2019s\u2014our brains seem naturally to collect things in 365-day chunks. Generally, looking back is a winsome affair, a reminder of how far we\u2019ve come, even if it\u2019s touched with sorrow for lost loves or forgotten pastimes. This week, though, things are different. This week is a reminder of the days when everything changed. BackchannelAn Oral History of the Day Everything ChangedGarrett M. GraffYear in ReviewThe Death of FOMO As We Knew ItSofia BarnettDigital Culture Doomscrolling Is Slowly Eroding Your Mental HealthAngela WatercutterYesterday, the world marked the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a global pandemic. But the entire week was marked by remembrances of the Lasts: the last time someone went to a basketball game, a movie, a restaurant. The last day in the office, the last time they hugged their mom or went outside without a face covering. Technology is designed to remind us of these things: Timehop, the random photos your iPhone surfaces, your memories on Facebook. Earlier this week, Instagram prompted me, \u201cSee your post from two years ago today,\u201d and I was reminded of seeing Robyn at Madison Square Garden. I burst into tears at the thought of singing along with 20,000 sweaty strangers\u2014and that show came nine months before I would know what a novel coronavirus was.We also do this to ourselves. For the past seven days, my timelines\u2014and presumably timelines everywhere\u2014have been filled with people\u2019s remembrances of where they were when, say, they heard the NBA was shutting down, or that travel was becoming increasingly dangerous. There\u2019s even a new Twitter feed devoted to this: @YearCovid, which is dedicated to \u201clivetweeting the covid pandemic as it happened on this date in 2020.\u201d Following the account means getting semi-frequent reminders of what the news stories and social media reactions were on any given day in 2020. If you were starting to feel like there weren\u2019t enough reminders of how much you life has changed, this feed will solve that.Nostalgia is tricky that way. Definitionally it means homesickness, or \u201ca wistful or excessively sentimental yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition.\u201d But, when you\u2019re talking about a disease that killed loved ones and ground the world\u2019s traditions to a halt, the phrase \u201cirrecoverable condition\u201d becomes even more inconceivable. In normal times, when one is feeling nostalgic for their youth, it\u2019s still possible to visit childhood friends or pull out old albums. What\u2019s happening now is more a yearning for what happened before Covid-19, not for the time it took away from us.Portuguese actually has a better word for the latter: saudade. It\u2019s hard to come up with a one-to-one translation, but it generally means a deep longing for something missing, almost a nostalgia for something one never experienced. WIRED writer Sofia Barnett touched on this a few months back in her essay on the death of FOMO. We no longer have a fear of missing out on one night out with friends or a family get-together. Instead, people are collectively mourning a year when those events barely happened at all. Now, like everything else during the pandemic, we\u2019re sharing that online. That, it seems, is the prevailing feeling of this moment: aching for what\u2019s been lost, but also for what might have been.More Great WIRED Stories\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Sex tapes, hush money, and Hollywood\u2019s economy of secretsHow to set up a 4G LTE Wi-Fi network in your homeWhat do TV\u2019s race fantasies actually want to say?The woman bulldozing video games\u2019 toughest DRMEmail and Slack have locked us in a productivity paradox\ud83c\udfae WIRED Games: Get the latest tips, reviews, and more\u2728 Optimize your home life with our Gear team\u2019s best picks, from robot vacuums to affordable mattresses to smart speakers", "author": "Angela Watercutter"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T17:00:00Z", "title": "Tim Wu and Lina Khan Can Now Put Antitrust Theories to Work", "full_article": "Hey, everyone.

Mind uploading is a familiar trope, but science fiction author Tobias S. Buckell says that Upload presents an interesting new spin on the idea.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all heard about people getting uploaded, and we all know how people can use the virtual world to live out their fantasies, but it was really interesting how the virtual world becomes a world with consequences and problems and issues that the character has to navigate,\u201d Buckell says in Episode 457 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast.\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nhttps://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/geeksguide457final.mp3 \n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\niTunes\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\nNathan finds himself in a virtual community called Lakeview, where he\u2019s constantly harried by intrusive ads and in-app purchases. Science fiction author Abby Goldsmith says that Lakeview\u2019s oppressive blandness is exactly what you\u2019d expect from a tech company. \u201cIt\u2019s some soulless corporation that has no creativity,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably got 10 committees coming up with things, and they\u2019re all erasing good ideas.\u201d\nGeek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley was impressed at the way that Upload grapples with the economic realities of mind uploading. As long as there are servers that require power and maintenance, any afterlife is bound to be temporary.\n\u201cYou would be in the afterlife, but you still know that you\u2019re going to die someday,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just depends on how long your family\u2014your descendants, or whoever cares about you in the real world\u2014is willing to keep paying for it. So it just becomes another life where death is a constant reality, rather than escaping from it.\u201d\nScience fiction editor John Joseph Adams enjoyed Upload\u2018s mix of science fiction, humor, and romance. He hopes the show doesn\u2019t morph into too much of a thriller, a fate that has befallen similar shows such as HBO\u2019s Years and Years. \u201cIt would be easy for this show to follow down that same path and go too far with those same thriller elements, getting too far away from the cool science fiction and comedy stuff that made us love it in the first place,\u201d he says.\nListen to the complete interview with Tobias S. Buckell, Abby Goldsmith, and John Joseph Adams in Episode 457 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\nJohn Joseph Adams on science:\n\u201cOne of the places where I had a bunch of issues with the show is with some of the various ways technology is implemented, or even just science. Nathan has a punctured lung, and that\u2019s pretty treatable even now, let alone in 2033\u2014presumably in 12 years it\u2019ll be even easier to treat that. And I get that you don\u2019t want to risk dying on the table, because then you miss out on your chance of getting uploaded, but that didn\u2019t really seem like a big risk there. He\u2019s already in the hospital. If it seems like he\u2019s going to die, go upload him. But also I was very confused when they sit him down in a chair and vaporize his head, and then the body collapses into a vat of ice.

And everyone in real life is moving on, and having their own moment, and he\u2019s not really a part of it. I thought that was really fascinating. There\u2019s just some stuff going on about how we move on from people, and how that might scare us, and how that might be a fear that you have after you leave\u2014how your memories linger on or don\u2019t. He is watching some of those things happen in real time, because he has that access to the other side of real life. So like a stranded ghost he\u2019s just on the other side being ignored by most of the people at his funeral, just looking at the aftermath of his life.\u201d\nDavid Barr Kirtley on love triangles:\n\u201cToward the end of the season we see Ingrid\u2018s family for the first time, and they\u2019re this very wealthy family, and they\u2019re just really awful to each other all the time. So we see that she\u2019s actually not as bad as the environment that produced her. That was good, but I feel like we could have maybe used more of that. Because it\u2019s kind of this love triangle, but in a love triangle usually you would want \u2018Team Nora\u2018 and \u2018Team Ingrid\u2019 or something, and I feel like the way the show is presented, nobody is going to think that Nathan should stay with Ingrid. I think it might be more interesting if 20 percent or 30 percent of viewers would be like, \u2018No, I like Ingrid.\u2019 If it\u2019s foreordained, it\u2019s less interesting to me, it seems.\u201d\nTobias S. Buckell on consciousness:\n\u201cAll of the cells that make up your brain matter aren\u2019t cells that were there five years ago, because there\u2019s death, renewal, and birth even inside of your tissue. And so there are some theories that the way to transfer consciousness would be to slowly move a little bit of your brain while still being connected to something, and then once you\u2019ve incorporated that, you keep moving a little bit more over and a little bit more over, just like the natural life-death-birth of cells inside of your body. You just incorporate moving part of yourself to a mechanical product, so that it\u2019s this slow transference over, instead of this instant thing where you make a copy.

While they affect an astronomical number of computing devices, the so-called speculative execution bugs are relatively difficult to exploit in practice. But now researchers from Google have developed a proof-of-concept that shows the danger Spectre attacks pose to the browser\u2014in hopes of motivating a new generation of defenses.Researchers have never doubted that Spectre could be exploited for browser-based hacks. Every program running on a computer executes its instructions and crunches its data through the computer's processor and memory, making all of that information potentially vulnerable to speculative execution attacks. That includes browsers, which load data from web servers and then display the content on individual users' devices through a local feature called a rendering engine. A Spectre browser hack would essentially launch an attack from one web page a victim is visiting to grab data from other pages they have open. Such hacks could even be used to impersonate a target to pull down more of their data from web apps they're logged into.\u00a0In the years since the initial Spectre and Meltdown revelations, that specific type of attack has never been seen in the wild, and it was unclear how practical the method would be. Google's proof-of-concept against its own Chrome browser not only illustrates feasibility, but also hints at strategies for both browsers and web developers to guard more comprehensively against such attacks.\u201cWhen I shared the exploit with the Chrome security team and the product security team, at that point everyone was like, \u2018OK, wow, it\u2019s very clear this is the impact,\u2019\u201d says Stephen\u00a0R\u00f6ttger, security engineer at Google. \u201cBased on this we made a bunch of decisions to put more resources into rolling out Spectre defenses across our web frameworks.\u201d\u201cWe think we have wrapped our heads around what developers need to do to protect themselves.\u201dMike West, Google ChromeOver the last few years, Chrome and other mainstream browsers have implemented a practice called \"site isolation\" to render web pages separately and silo their data from each other. Since Spectre attacks are all about inducing a processor to leak data at an opportune moment, site isolation makes it much more difficult for a hacker to grab the sensitive information they want, since the data isn't all flowing through the processor in the same place at the same time. Browsers have also added related defenses to load components of a single website separately (like a company's own logo versus third-party ads) and to block data from flowing in both directions between two pages when the reciprocity isn't vital.These types of defenses can't stop Spectre attacks altogether. They instead reduce the chances that a bad actor could grab any useful or private information from the processor if they do launch such a hack. The proof-of-concept from R\u00f6ttger and his colleagues reveals more nuanced ways that browsers, including Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge, can implement these types of defenses. But it also highlights the ways that web developers could architect their platforms and applications differently to preserve functionality while locking down user information even more strategically.\u201cWe think we have wrapped our heads around what developers need to do to protect themselves and the set of things they need to do is not astoundingly large,\u201d says Mike West, head of Chrome platform security and cochair of the World Wide Web Consortium\u00a0web application security working group. \u201cThe real work, and the reason that the browsers can\u2019t do it on the developer\u2019s behalf, is that the decisions that need to be made are application-specific. They\u2019re going to involve an analysis of the things your server offers to the internet and the ways in which those things ought to be offered.\u201dGoogle is working through W3C, an international standards body, to propose guidelines and best practices for both browsers and web developers. The strategy has worked for Google before, as in its effort to help move the needle on massive initiatives like promoting HTTPS web encryption. But West acknowledges that it takes time to get the entire web community on board with these types of structural changes.", "author": "Lily Hay Newman"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T13:17:40Z", "title": "WTF Is an NFT, Anyway?

The several-week-old Australasian snapper, no longer than a pinkie nail, rested flat on a slab of modeling clay, held down by small staples\u2014\u201cas someone would strap you down on an ambulance bed to hold you there,\u201d says Radford. He stuck tiny electrodes on the fish\u2019s head, then submerged it in a tank and switched on an underwater speaker. It was time to test its hearing. \u201cIf you actually put your head underwater and take the time to listen, it's amazing what you'll hear,\u201d Radford says. \u201cFrom whales to fish to crustaceans\u2014sound plays an important role in many, many different species\u2019 life strategies.\u201dBut Radford\u2019s experiment wasn\u2019t due to curiosity about what the world sounds like to fish. He was worried about how well they could hear it.Life-forms lurking in Earth's oceans depend a lot on what humans do above the surface. After we burn the carbon-rich fuels that nations mine, chop, and slurp out of the ground, they meander into the atmosphere as pollution, such as carbon dioxide. Increased CO2 in the atmosphere leads to more dissolved CO2 in the oceans, too, where it acidifies plant and animal habitats. In some cases, the consequences make intuitive sense: A more acidic ocean corrodes coral reefs and the symbiotic microorganisms hanging around them. But other effects are less straightforward, and Radford and his team found a weird one: The CO2 levels can morph the inner ears of fish, leading to hearing loss.In a new study, a team of researchers from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and James Cook University in Australia used neural electrodes and a micro CT scanner to measure the first evidence of what happens to reef fish hearing when larvae develop in a more acidic ocean. They found that the juvenile Australasian snapper can be roughly 10 times less sensitive to sound\u2014a potentially fatal blow to animals that rely on hearing to find their way home. The team\u2019s result highlights a surprising example of knock-on effects of atmospheric change. The work was published last week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\u201cIt's not intuitive that fish would not be able to hear, or not be able to smell, or not be able to behave correctly,\u201d says Sean Bignami, a biologist running Concordia University Irvine\u2019s Marine Lab, who was not involved with the study. Bignami studies how acidification affects ocean life, and he studied fish inner ears in his doctoral work. \u201cI think it's fascinating,\u201d he says of the new results.Many reef fish are actually hatched in the open ocean, and the juveniles must swim back to the reef where they will make their home, Radford says. \u201cA lot of work has shown that sound is an orientation cue to find their way back,\u201d he says. Messing with that sense of hearing can threaten a species\u2019 survival.Sound is a major concern for marine ecologists studying how human behavior in the air-breathing world affects our finned kin. Warming oceans make snapping shrimp snap louder, creating noisy interference for their underwater neighbors, and an enormous review published in Science in February, on which Radford was a coauthor, concluded that human noise has made the \u201csoundscape\u201d unbearable for sea creatures. Noise pollution drowns out whale sounds, for instance, which complicates socializing and mating.Fish, including the Australasian snapper, use sound to communicate, procreate, and orientate. Some use it to attract mates or synchronize egg and sperm release. Some baby fish use it to find suitable reefs to live in.", "author": "Max G.

Instead, the game makes me stressed, paranoid, and frustrated. And yet, since last fall, I've been playing Among Us with locked-down friends across the country every week. It's a game of suspicion, and somehow, thus one of excitement and connection, which is a bit of a paradox\u2014but one that can be explained by some insights into human psychology.A social deduction game, the essential rules of Among Us are straightforward. Players are either categorized as innocents or as spies. Most are innocents, and their goal is to deduce who the spies are before the spies kill them all. In Among Us, the innocents are Crewmates and the spies Imposters, and the intrigue takes place on a spaceship prone to sabotage. Launched in June 2018, it was a surprise hit of 2020; US representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar played it on a Twitch livestream in October, and in November it broke half a billion monthly players.It\u2019s a game that, though periodically silent, demands that you talk. Perhaps it\u2019s no wonder, then, that Among Us took off in a year of experiments in remote society, as we all ran out of things to say over Zoom. But what explains the gravitational pull of this social deduction game? Why do players frequently make bad decisions? And why did my own friends collectively vote to eject me, while I was diligently refuelling the engines?Liar Liar Pants on FireWell, for one thing, humans are generally terrible at identifying lies. For Chris Street, a cognitive psychologist and expert in lie detection at the University of Huddersfield, social deduction games are variants on the classic guessing game: Which hand is the coin in?What at first appears to be a simple \u201cthis one, not that one\u201d decision invites a spiral of second-guesses. \u201cWhat if they are bluffing, but they know that I know that they are bluffing?\u201d says Street. \u201cSocial deduction games frame the penny problem in a more structured world, where there is useful information to be gleaned if you pull at the claims around the table and find out which unravel.\u201dWhere liars can use any number of persuasive tactics to build trust, from pretending to complete tasks in Among Us to denouncing other Imposters, figuring out who is a spy need not be simply a case of refining your bullshit detector.More From Gamesthe psychology of gamesThe Sims Made Me Realize I'm Ready for More In LifeSaira Muellerlet me be meGames Don\u2019t Judge You for Expressing Your True SelfIsabelle Davisbarrens chatWhen World of Warcraft Is an Escape\u2014and a MemorialTanner Laguatan\u201cI think we all hope for some hidden secret ability to root out the truth by detecting subtle behaviors and tells,\u201d says Street. \u201cReality is less forgiving. Across many research studies over the decades, our best estimate of people\u2019s lie detecting ability is ever so slightly better than guessing, with an accuracy of 54 percent, when 50 percent could be achieved by guessing at random.\u201dWhile there is research suggesting that liars give off behavioral cues\u2014one influential paper claims that bluffers tend to tell simpler stories with narrower vocabulary and more negative emotion words\u2014Street ascribes this skein of psychology largely to the realm of TV. \u201cPopular fiction tells us that there may be subtle indicators of deception in the liar\u2019s behavior,\u201d he says. However, \u201cwhen we lie, we do not give ourselves away so easily. If our lies were so readily detectable, we would likely choose not to lie in the first place.\u201dLiars may not give off obvious cues, but innocent players aren\u2019t completely rudderless. When we pick up on lies, it\u2019s because we recognize information in the speaker\u2019s claim that is contradicted by the howling of other players, or because we caught them leaping from one the vents on the Among Us spaceship. In Street\u2019s Adaptive Lie Detector theory, he suggests that people adapt to rely on context to guide their credulity. And when we play a social deduction game like Among Us\u2014or Street\u2019s preferred title, The Resistance\u2014we\u2019re already apprehensive. Street owns 160 board games and many of them are social deduction games. Yet given his somewhat pessimistic view on human lie detecting abilities, I\u2019m not surprised when he says his expertise fails to furnish an advantage on the tabletop.Humans Are Not, In Fact, RationalAnother reason Among Us players make poor decisions is that the design of social deduction games confounds the resources in our brain. \u201cThey mostly challenge our wits,\u201d says Celia Hodent, an expert in game user experience and author of The Psychology of Video Games. \u201cMore specifically, they challenge our attention. We need to focus on what\u2019s going on, use our memory to connect the dots, while also engaging our logical reasoning and communication skills.\u201d", "author": "Kyle Hoekstra"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T12:00:00Z", "title": "The Perplexing Psychology of Returning to \u2018Normal\u2019", "full_article": "Last night, on the anniversary of what was more or less the start of the worst year of our collective lives, President Joe Biden shocked the nation with a vibe most of us had long forgotten: optimism. All American adults would be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine by May 1, he declared. And if we behave ourselves by wearing our masks and social distancing, Biden continued, \u201cby July the 4th, there\u2019s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue, and celebrate Independence Day.\u201d (Within reason, of course\u2014large gatherings are still a no-no.) \u201cAfter this long, hard year,\u201d Biden added, \u201cthat will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\u201dBut independence does not mean a return to normalcy. For a year now, we\u2019ve been living in constant fear for our own health and that of our loved ones. We\u2019ve feared losing our jobs and America\u2019s scant safety net not catching us if we fall. Structural inequality has ensured, as always, that the poor and people of color suffer the most in a catastrophe. For essential workers, showing up to work has been a matter of life and death, a stress typically reserved for soldiers. It\u2019s been, in a word, surreal.When you get that vaccine shot in your arm, it\u2019s not like some switch will flip and your stress will melt away. Neurobiologically, it doesn\u2019t work like that. \u201cThe experience of heightened arousal, difficulty sleeping, irritability, wanting to drink and smoke to cope\u2014all of those manifestations of stress may take a while to subside, because our nervous system has been chronically dialed up for a year now,\u201d says Adrienne Heinz, a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \u201cJust because a war is over, doesn't mean that what happened during the war doesn't still activate you, doesn't still haunt you in some ways. There's a healing that will need to take place.\u201dThe psychological archvillain here is uncertainty. Certainty for our distant ancestors was a social structure that helped them find food\u2014and avoid becoming food. Certainty was the invention of agriculture and irrigation, which allowed our more recent ancestors to build up food and water surpluses. Certainty today is rigid routine: spouse, kids, mortgage, commute, work, and so on.The Covid-19 pandemic is uncertainty incarnate. None of us had previously lived through a pandemic like this, so we had no prior knowledge of how to cope. In the beginning, we didn\u2019t know who was at most risk, nor what situations we should avoid, nor even how the virus was most likely to spread. We didn\u2019t know if we should wear masks right away, or if we could safely send our kids to school. And don\u2019t forget the dizzying number of candidate treatments for Covid-19, from convalescent plasma to hydroxychloroquine, which were hyped on the internet as quick fixes but didn\u2019t stand up to clinical testing. Even when scientists better characterized the virus, the damn thing remained invisible, so the average person didn\u2019t know where it lurked.Then the vaccines landed, and we had to wait for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to tell us what\u2019s safe for vaccinated people to do. (As of March 8, the CDC now says they can gather indoors with one another unmasked but still need to wear masks in public. And no big gatherings, under any circumstances.) Most of us still don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll get our own shot, and on a population level, it\u2019s not clear when we\u2019ll reach herd immunity, thus finally bringing the pandemic under control.", "author": "Matt Simon"}, {"date": "2021-03-12T12:00:00Z", "title": "So You Want to Prepare for Doomsday", "full_article": "The preppers have the best stuff. It\u2019s because they operate under such constraints: You have to pack your whole society\u2014money, tinctures, food powders\u2014in a lone bag. Then, when the big bug-out comes, you slip on your paracord bracelets and shemagh scarf and vanish into the woods, to an already-scouted redoubt obscured by trees. There, beside your tent, you gnaw jerky and sip bleached snowmelt out of 5-gallon bags, wrapped in a 26-micron bivy that reflects 90 percent of body heat. A society of one.\u00a0 By day you carefully inventory the dozens of curated objects in your bag, rifling through sub-pockets, enumerating ibuprofen, contemplating seed packets, calculating caloric yields. Portable hand-cranked flashlight. Clove oil for toothache. At night, with darkness yielding to bright gray inside your night-vision goggles, you patrol, hand hovering near your CZ-75 P-01. Far off down the mountain you hear the cracks, groans, whistles, and shots of a splintering society. A week ago you administered an Oracle database. Now your job is to \u00adsurvive.\u00a0And you dream: One day, after the smoke of civilization has drifted away, you\u2019ll link up with others exactly like you. A new world will rise out of your duffel bag. You\u2019ll hang up solar-powered mesh networks from trees and make your own internet. You\u2019ll transact for potatoes and penicillin on the blockchain under the watch of vigilant owls. But now, jerky.\u00a0What the preppers do is fully acknowledge their fears and turn them into a particular aesthetic. Like goths. They make their anxieties perfectly legible. I get it. I read My Side of the Mountain when I was a kid. But while prepper gear is awesome, I keep thinking: We should be trying to avoid a civil war, not packing for one.The Aesthetics Wiki has hundreds of different entries\u2014Preppy and Punk, of course, but also more modern aesthetics like Dark Academia (Eurocentricity, Whit Stillman, sweaters), Vaporwave (synths, VHS boxes, teal), or  Cottagecore (short\u00adalls, Hozier). Many of the aesthetics have left- and right-wing offshoots: Vaporwave has produced Laborwave and Fashwave; Tradwifery (patriarchy, heteronormativity, childbirth) can be understood as reactionary Cottagecoreism.\u00a0I would have told you I don\u2019t have an aesthetic. But a few months ago my family moved to an old house, not far from our old apartment. This house has a yard and asbestos and a plaque on the front that says: 1913. Multiple generations of telephone wiring run along and inside the walls, and jacks abound: Bell System four-pin 404A jacks and modular 6P4C jacks, too, all useless in 2021. I like them. They suggest critical infrastructure come and gone. The people who lived in the house before us sent a kind, slightly melancholy note, wishing us the best, but we never met them. Pandemic transaction.\u00a0When we moved in, we immediately started to plan for an apocalypse. (My spouse\u2019s elementary school overlooked Donner Lake in California, so worst-case scenarios come easily to her; she has a disaster-preparedness Pinterest board.) I figured out where we could put the tilapia tanks and pondered a new fence. We could store barrels of powdered food in the basement. Following decades of living within the collective fortress of an apartment building, a house\u2014just sitting there by the street\u2014feels extremely vulnerable.

I enjoyed flirting with the himbos and picking out bikinis for lazy days of sunbathing. The thrills are simplistic, and the conversations are vapid. This experience might be what most players expect from dating sims, but numerous development teams have subverted expectations for the genre.Originally released in 2011 by Japanese developer Hato Moa, Hatoful Boyfriend is an absurdist trailblazer and avian love story in which you are the singular human student attending St. PigeoNation\u2019s Institute, a high school for talented (and flirtatious) birds. The visual novel is surprisingly campy and saturated with wordplay. I played through this dating sim a few times to further investigate a mysterious side plot involving the menacing school doctor.The birds at this school just love to gossip.\nCourtesy of PigeoNation Inc.Another dating simulator that subverts audience expectations is Doki Doki Literature Club! The opening of this visual novel feigns a stereotypical aesthetic, but the facade is slowly ripped away as Doki Doki\u2019s metafictional undercurrent is revealed to the player.Personally, my favorite example of this genre is Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. You play as an eligible dad who relocates to a comfortable cul de sac that contains seven attractive dads who invite you to cookouts, flirt with you on DadBook, and enjoy corny dad jokes almost as much as your character. In a WIRED UK review from 2017, Matt Kamen wrote that the dating sim, \u201cstands as one of the best in the genre.\u201dRaptor Boyfriend, an upcoming dating sim set in a 1990s high school, appears to strike a tone somewhere between Hatoful Boyfriend and Dream Daddy. You play as Stella, a socially anxious teenager attempting to navigate her identity and choose from three cryptid suitors. Elements from both visual novels are found in Raptor Boyfriend. In a way, Raptor Boyfriend is an absurdist bildungsroman with nonhuman suitors like Hatoful Boyfriend and, similar to Dream Daddy, the visual novel is a queer fantasia that will likely appeal to the LGBTQ+ community.Before the official release of their game (currently available to wish-list on Steam,) I chatted with Rocket Adrift, the independent dev team behind Raptor Boyfriend. The team is composed of three members: Titus McNally as a lead programmer and UI/UX designer, Lindsay Rollins as a programmer and character artist, and Pat Smith as a composer and background artist.

Levanti, who normally posts videos with topics like \u201cweird food that celebrities like to eat\u201d or \u201cannoying things people do at the gym,\u201d was distressed, and he immediately decided to make a TikTok video about it. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not responsibly use my big platform to educate people and wake some people up the way I was?\u201dIn the TikTok video, Levanti, superimposed over an image of Earth on fire, says, \u201cHey, stop scrolling. Our planet is fucking dying.\u201d It\u2019s gotten over 314,000 views and been shared nearly 14,000 times. There are over 5,000 comments, some of which are heartbreaking: \u201cI am 13, does that mean my future children will suffer.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sad that younger people have to suffer because of this.\u201dLevanti says that it distressed him to read the comments, especially the ones from younger users. \u201cThere are young kids on this app that won\u2019t be able to experience this planet in the way I have, and I am only 24, so I\u2019ve barely experienced it.\u201dA Climate Discussion Is Happening on TikTokThe world is facing a climate change problem, and climate change is facing a communication problem. The complexities and hypotheticals of climate science do not translate well to an audience who just wants to know whether the dress was blue or white. And yet, on TikTok, one of the world\u2019s most active communication platforms, climate change is a rapidly growing topic. The hashtag #ForClimate has over 533 million views. A video showing a girl singing, \u201cWe\u2019re killing the earth and that\u2019s really fun, nobody believes us because we are young,\u201d has over 6.4 million likes. Every day, thousands of mostly Gen Z content creators post videos about climate change and their personal relationship to it. In the span of five minutes, you can get tips on the zero waste movement, watch a teenager cry while looking at starving polar bears, learn about environmental racism, and see scientists working in Antarctica.The idea that a bunch of TikTok users can change the world, while seemingly preposterous, is actually pretty accurate. In June 2020, a group of TikTok creators encouraged their fans to register for a rally for former President Trump and then not show. Over a million tickets were requested; less than 7,000 people attended. It was a public humiliation for Trump and a win for TikTok. When George Floyd\u2019s murder sparked public outrage, TikTok creators flooded the platform with #BlackLivesMatter content. Abortion clinic defenders are taking videos of religious protesters and posting them on TikTok to support abortion rights. We\u2019re already seeing TikTok users pushing for real, grassroots social change.Thomas Schinko, leader of the Equity and Justice Research Group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, says the storytelling aspect of TikTok is what makes it so effective. \u201cFrom our research experience we know that storytelling is key for communicating the climate crisis in a way that can lead to taking action.\u201d According to Schinko, TikTok has incredible potential as an arts-based activist platform. \u201cWith creative ideas, artistic works, and a lot of commitment, they show in a partly humorous, partly frightening and disturbing way how important it is to protect the climate.\u201d", "author": "Emma Pattee"}, {"date": "2021-03-11T13:00:00Z", "title": "We Need More Covid-19 Data on the LGBTQ+ Community", "full_article": "In the early days of the pandemic, Colorado\u2019s openly gay governor, Jared Polis, justified not collecting data on sexual orientation and gender identity in Covid-19 databases by  saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of [LGBTQ+] people in Colorado who don\u2019t want that info out there \u2026 while we love data, we don\u2019t want to ask people for data they are not comfortable sharing.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said: \u201cThis virus doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u201dBut we know that it does. And the proper data could help us better address that.WIRED OPINIONABOUTLala Tanmoy Das is an MD-PhD student in New York City with a background in health IT.Research has consistently shown us that preexisting conditions are strongly associated with much greater likelihood of severe Covid-19 disease and worse health outcomes. And according to a recently released study from the CDC, self-reported data from 2017\u201319 shows that compared to heterosexual adults, sexual minority Americans have significantly higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions including cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, hypertension, and obesity. Sexual minorities of color are even more impacted. But unfortunately, this CDC analysis is only one of a very limited number of studies providing a glimpse into how the LGBTQ+ community specifically is being impacted by Covid-19. This is precipitated, in part, by the lack of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data captured in Covid-19 surveillance systems, such as hospital intake forms and testing center questionnaires. (At the time of this writing, only a handful of states and jurisdictions like Pennsylvania, Washington, and the District of Columbia are planning to or already capturing this data. )Despite claims that individuals would be uncomfortable sharing SOGI data, research shows that a fair number of people do not find such questions difficult or sensitive to report for themselves or others in their households when the questions are worded properly. And while at the very outset sexual minority status and gender identity might seem irrelevant to a predominantly respiratory, viral illness, knowing this information can have significant bearings on better understanding quarantine and isolation behaviors, ability to perform routine health care maintenance, mental health needs, and support networks that are all critical to disease transmission and severity of clinical course. And for LGBTQ+ people of color, who are even more vulnerable to severe cases due to intersectional minority identities compounded by systemic racism and minority stress, having this information can be critical to streamlining culturally sensitive public health interventions to minimize the toll of Covid-19.Unfortunately, the hesitancy to collect SOGI information, despite it appearing in optional data fields like any other demographic determinant of health, is far from unique to Covid-19 databases. Currently, only 11 federal surveys out of more than 100 collect some data on sexual orientation of LGBT Americans. However, these surveys are piecemeal and extremely specialized, making it difficult to understand specific trends and needs of sexual minority Americans at a holistic, nationwide level. At a more localized, community health level, many doctor\u2019s offices and health care systems don\u2019t routinely collect SOGI data in patient\u2019s electronic health records.It\u2019s not that the technical capabilities don\u2019t exist. On the contrary, in 2015, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology issued a final rule that mandated the ability to collect SOGI data as a technical requirement for regulatory compliance with the Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records program. But the policy doesn\u2019t require clinicians to actually collect this data from patients. This translates to an odd dichotomy where a system-wide capability is required for certification, but its actual use is not.Beyond the technical pipelines and system requirements, the mechanics of accurately and sensitively capturing SOGI data also require significant thought and consideration. Some people understandably have privacy concerns about how or where this data will be stored or used, while others worry whether their health care provider would treat them differently for openly identifying as a sexual or gender minority. Some people with experience of blatant homophobia might find these questions triggering and uncomfortable. And others might also question the relevance of collecting this data for a vast array of clinical encounters not seemingly contingent upon their SGM status.", "author": "Lala Tanmoy Das"}, {"date": "2021-03-11T13:00:00Z", "title": "The 25 Best Deals From Outdoor Winter Clearance Sales", "full_article": "Now's the best time to buy winter gear. The season might be winding down, but the savings are substantial. When I got into mountain climbing years ago and had to get all the equipment, it happened to be during the annual end-of-winter sales, and I lucked into some terrific prices. Plan ahead and you too can save serious money. Updated March 11, 2021: REI's winter clearance sale is over, but many items are still discounted. Backcountry and Moosejaw's winter sales are still going.

Read our Best Fitness Trackers and Best Laptop Bags guides.REI Flash 18 Pack for $20 ($20 off): Taking a big, bloated pack on a day hike is unnecessary suffering. For a quick \u201cget outside\u201d bag, the Flash 18 is one of our favorites because it's lightweight and cheap but has enough room for a rain jacket, lunch, sunscreen, and water. This is the outgoing Flash 18, which is not made of bluesign-approved, more sustainable materials like the just-introduced model.Black Diamond Momentum Climbing Shoes for $70 ($25 off): These are solid, non-aggressive climbing shoes\u2014good for novice climbers and those who, regardless of skill level, tackle certain types of smooth outdoor rock, such as granite slab. They're some of the most comfortable sub-$100 climbing shoes I've worn. The women's version is on sale for the same price.REI Co-Op Multi Towel Lite for $5 ($5 off): You should have a couple of pack towels when you're backpacking. Condensation and mist collect on your backpack as the weather changes. To keep it from soaking into your fabric and weighing you down, it's helpful to have a small towel handy to periodically wipe it down.Mountain Hardwear Crag Wagon 35 for $142 ($78 off): If you do any outdoor climbing, you'll need a pack big enough to haul everything. A regular, little ol' daypack can work if you're not carrying a full rack of gear, but it's nicer to be able to store your helmet and climbing shoes inside instead of dangling them on the outside. This 35-liter pack will swallow all of it, and the front panel unzips to make loading and unloading easier than on a top-opening pack.MSR Windburner Stove Group System for $160 ($40 off): MSR makes some of the best stoves in the business. The Windburner runs on MSR IsoPro canisters, which contain an 80/20 mix of isobutane and propane. The kit also comes with a 2.5-liter pot with a locking lid that lets you pack up the stove, stand, and IsoPro canister (not included) inside the pot when you're not using it.Black Diamond Camalot C4 Package #1-3 for 198 ($22 off): If you want to start climbing trad or need to update your rack, you're going to need cams. BD's Camalot C4 series is the standard many use to judge the competition, because it's been around a long time and is widely used. The new generation is 10 percent lighter than the outgoing C4 cams.Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Trekking Poles for $135 ($45 off): I've banged and abused carbon-fiber Black Diamond trekking poles over some nasty trail rocks, and they've held up well. The cork hand grips are cushiony and handle sweaty palms well. I'm not sure I'd want to go back to non-cork handles. Trekking poles are useful for stability and taking some of the strain off your legs and knees.Garmin Forerunner 735XT Run-Bundle for $240 ($160 off): WIRED writer Adrienne So, who tests fitness trackers among other things, says this is a great deal. It includes an HRM-Run chest strap that measures your heart rate. The Forerunner 735XL has GPS, is water-resistant to 50 meters, and pairs with your Android or iOS smartphone.Toaks Titanium Folding Spork for $6 ($3 off): If backpacking had a symbol, it'd be the titanium spork. Toaks is a solid manufacturer of titanium cookware.

The first big test of how the push for wind energy might clash with ocean conservation will likely play out in Massachusetts waters. This week, Department of the Interior officials  gave initial approval to the $2.8 billion Vineyard Wind project located about 15 miles south of the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.Once the massive wind turbines begin operating in 2023, the wind farm is expected to generate 800 megawatts of clean electricity. That\u2019s enough to power 400,000 Massachusetts homes and businesses.Vineyard Wind will be the first big offshore wind farm on the East Coast, although smaller pilot projects are running off Block Island, Rhode Island, and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Officials at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, an office within the Department of the Interior, are reviewing another 12 commercial offshore wind projects between Maryland and Maine. If approved, those wind farms would generate 25 gigawatts of clean energy for the power-hungry Northeast, more than doubling all land-based wind power coming online in 2021.It hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing for wind farms. When WIRED last covered this project, in 2019, it was expected to be completed by 2021. But the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management delayed the project\u2019s approval to review the cumulative impact of US offshore wind farms, while the company itself pulled its application to choose a different kind of turbine. Once that application was resubmitted earlier this year, the bureau approved the final environmental impact statement in several weeks.The renewed push for offshore wind power is part of a Biden administration executive order issued in January to halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters and replace them with clean energy. Nearly one quarter of all US greenhouse gas emissions come from oil and gas wells on federal leases, and the White House sees a big potential to cut those planet-warming emissions with offshore wind projects.But the project has gotten pushback from both environmental groups and local fishers, who say they won\u2019t be able to navigate their boats around the 700-foot tall towers or dredge the seafloor for valuable scallops and surf clams without getting tangled in power cables. The cables are \u201can obstruction and a safety hazard, and they will block fishing access,\u201d says Annie Hawkins, director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance, an advocacy group representing the Northeast and New England commercial fishing industry. \u201cThe cables take up more space than the turbines and create more risks than the turbines themselves.\u201dHawkins says her group has been pushing federal regulators to force Vineyard Wind to make wider sea lanes through the wind farm, so fishing boats would have more room to operate. The current plan has the turbines spaced a mile apart. As part of the overall Department of the Interior environmental review of Vineyard Wind\u2019s application, the US Coast Guard did not approve the idea of broader 4-mile lanes over concerns it could lead to crowding on the seas.During the decade the project has been under development, Vineyard Wind has shrunk its proposed footprint. Initially, the firm planned to use 100 turbines producing 8 megawatts each. But the technology has improved and turbines have grown bigger and more powerful. Earlier this year, Vineyard Wind switched to GE\u2019s new Halaide-X 13-megawatt turbine, reducing the overall number called for in its plan to 62 turbines, according to company spokesman Andrew Doba.", "author": "Eric Niiler"}, {"date": "2021-03-11T12:00:00Z", "title": "How to Find a Covid-19 Vaccine Appointment in Your Area", "full_article": "The data is in, and Covid-19 vaccines  are working.

Each of the three vaccines available use unique technologies to stimulate an immune response in your body, but none of them involve injecting a live virus into your arm. In short, they cannot get you sick with Covid-19.Vaccines, along with social distancing, masks, and smart policy decisions regarding reopening businesses, will be our ticket out of this hellish mass experience. But getting a vaccine is tricky, and how to do it varies widely by where you live.States, territories, and our one state-like district (DC) all have wide latitude to set their own Covid-19 policies and procedures. Advice and paths to a Covid-19 vaccine are going to differ based on which part of the US you live in, but we've put together a guide that should give you an accurate overview of how to get the jab.Table of ContentsFigure Out Your Place in LineCheck Your State's Rollout ProcessFind Places You Can Get VaccinatedWhat to Bring to Get VaccinatedGetting Your VaccineNot Yet Eligible?

The CDC issued guidelines on prioritizing certain groups by age and profession, but they are suggestions, not federal law. States have the final decision and are prioritizing groups of people slightly differently. You will need to check your own state's guidelines, but we've summarized the CDC's breakdown below, which should provide some rough guidance. In order from front of the line to back of the line:First Group (1a): Health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes.Second Group (1b): People 75 years old and older, if they're not already in a long-term care facility. Also, frontline essential works, such as firefighters, educators (including teachers, day care workers, and support staff), grocery store employees, public transit workers, postal workers, food and agricultural workers, manufacturing workers, police officers, and corrections officers.Third Group (1c): People 65 to 74 years old, if they're not already in a long-term care facility. People 16 to 64 years old with underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk for Covid-19. Also, non-frontline essential workers, such as \"people who work in transportation and logistics, food service, housing construction and finance, information technology, communications, energy, law, media, public safety, and public health,\" according to the CDC.Fourth Group: Everyone else.", "author": "Matt Jancer"}]
